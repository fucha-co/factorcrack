**Hi FACTOR! And Welcome to FACTOR Crack**. This dedicated website CV morphed from idea to delivery in less than 24 hours. I built it for you to showcase my skill as a conceptual creative, my ability to deliver on crazy deadlines, and because real creatives don't email CVs: real creatives create something out of nothing at every opportunity.

    <cite>Way back when I once dragged Robbie's arse around at the Noosa Crit after Alby & Bobby went off the front from the gun. I rode Robbie across to them — on my Pat — where Robbie still managed to get rolled. What a Cakehole! #laughing</cite>

<br>

**Briefly** I'm a complete digital creative suite wrapped in a single caring, sharing soul. 'For good' fuels my heart and being a great writer, coder, and communicator is just the start — my love, passion, compassion, and people skills are greater again.

<br>

**Broadly** I'm a brilliant writer, communicator, and conceptualist with bonus website management and coding skills, strong social media nous, advanced analytical and optimisation skills (including website performance, mobile web performance, Google Analytics, and Google Adwords), email marketing and e-commerce experience, plus a photographic eye and Photoshop skills. Furthermore I'm an expert in minimising online operating costs and maximising online operating returns. But even greater than my professional skills are my personal skills... and I don't use adverbs lightly.

<br>

**In the next few pages** you'll find my resume, referees, and learn more about me. Ultimately I hope you see how my personal and profession skills combined with my growth mindset and autodidact instincts can help FACTOR drive even more obsession.
