Writing's my greatest love but not my only skill — I have a bunch of others that gift me great insight into much bigger brand and business puzzles. Such skills allow me to see how different pieces compliment each other, and why, sometimes, compromises must be made.

**I Minimise [Costs]**

My deep understanding of the modern web and tech worlds allows me to effectively reduce and/or minimise online operating costs (if/where necessary). To highlight how much my knowledge compliments my skill sets **I've used this job application website as a case study in modern website practices and cost effectiveness**: the total cost to build, host, and serve this website over a secure connection (using bank-level security and encryption, or 'https') was $11.70. Of which the entire costs were absorbed by the domain registration — the only unavoidable cost. All other aspects of this website utilise the latest and greatest online technologies and services, many of which — in this modern world — are free for all to use. Now free is not always better or necessary, but it's always worth considering given the cost savings can significantly impact any business model.
