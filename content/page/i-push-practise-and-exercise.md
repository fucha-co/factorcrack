These days I also love to run — running is my new black. I've always found physical challenge as rewarding as the creative kind and pushing my mind and body ultimately brings out the best in both. And while I was never a Pro rider and never rode a Grandie I did once jump on the pushie and ride 3,300km in 21 days (on my Pat) for a personal challenge (raising money for charity along the way). I currently practice mindfulness, run regularly, drink rarely, drug never, fast intermittently, and Wim Hof daily. All of the above makes me a healthy and reliable employee who's still lean enough to be an awesome FACTOR ambassador...

<strong>tl;dw</strong> — Wimm Hof is redefining the science of human physiology through the power of his mind. It's almost unbelievable (and I don't use adverbs lightly!). Part of Wim's daily routine is cold water therapy. It's also part of mine.

When I'm not running, writing, or shivering Iceman-style I can be found strumming a ukulele, solving a Rubik's Cube, or streaming a podcast or two. I love to learn. I'm currently studying a diploma in Sign Language, a language like every other — one that connects people.
