I love photography. PHACES is personal growth project of mine and while the focus appears to be on those in front of the lens the real focus is always behind it. Nevertheless is showcases my handiness with a camera too: <a href="https://twitter.com/PhacesProject/media" target="_blank">www.phac.es</a> (this links to my PHACES Twitter account where it's easiest to see the photos. There's a few faces within that you're bound to know.).
